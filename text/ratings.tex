\section{Ratings and Rewards}\label{sec:ratings}

The \Jam chain does not explicitly issue rewards---we leave this as a job to be done by the staking subsystem (a system parachain---hosted without fees---in the current imagining of a public \Jam network). However, much as with validator punishment information, it is important for the \Jam chain to facilitate the arrival of performance information in to the staking subsystem so that it may be acted upon.

Such performance information cannot directly cover all aspects of validator activity; whereas block production, guarantor reports and availability assurance can easily be tracked on-chain, \textsc{Grandpa}, \textsc{Beefy} and auditing activity cannot. In the latter case, this is instead tracked with validator voting activity: validators vote on their impression of each other's efforts and a median may be accepted as the truth for any given validator. With an assumption of 50\% honest validators, this gives an adequate means of oraclizing this information.

%TODO: Al do we need to count this stuff explicitly per epoch? Any feedback required for Coretime?
